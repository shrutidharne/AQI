# Carbon-Catchers
CarbonCatchers is a project created for Smart India Hackathon 2023 that gives a solution for the problem statement(SIH-1324) which is based on the importance of air and water to human existence. 

Different types of human activities have resulted in environmental destruction and ruin. This project is based on creating an interactive website that uses a complex predictor algorithm to predict future environmental and nature degradation based on the current status of pollution indexes such as AQI(Air Quality Index )  and WQI(Water Quality Index).


## About AQI(Air Quality Index) and WQI(Water Quality Index)
AQI is based on current concentrations of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10 particles, CO, sulphur and nitrogen oxides and dust particles in the air around us.
It is generally instructed cities should have an AQI of below 100 for a safe lifestyle otherwise it is instructed to wear masks in public and try to remain in homes.

The Water Quality Index is based on current concentrations of harmful pollutants in used water sources. Indian rivers have been polluted rigorously by industrial waste dumps and chemical pollutants . Currently,  the Ganga River in some parts of India is not deemed safe for even bathing as that is the level of toxicity introduced in these rivers. Our Project will study the pollution of our atmosphere and water bodies and provide insights, suggestions and ways to decrease further pollution of our environment.

## About our project -Technologies Used
Our project includes building an AI predictor model that works on data fed from CSV files about AQI, WQI values and concentration of pollutants in specific regions and their pollution during particular times of the year. Using these data, we can predict future pollution and track the reasons for pollution currently.
We have built this AI model using Python and libraries. (Arion please add the names here)

This AI predictor model is integrated into the website that asks for your location and enables you to predict pollution occurring through your locality.
Our website is built using 
->HTML, CSS, Javascript and node.js
(Varad please add uses of web-Technologies here)
we further will shift our frontend to react.js and store collected pollution data in a database(Mongo DB).
